This is a stub Node.JS directory intended for use as a RESTful application server.
This is a work in progress. Hopefully will add various things in here shortly.

I have created paths for various things including:
* models
* views
* controllers
* middleware
* static files
* documentation
* examples

* Models is intended for modules that will interact with your respective data store.
* Views is intended for HTML, Jade, or other template languages that compile to HTML.
* Controllers is intended for modules that specify route logic for URI paths.
* Middleware is intended for various modules that specify Connect.JS middleware.
* Static is intended for static files that will be served by a static file server. :P
* Doc is intended for various documentation regarding the application.
* Example is intended for various usage examples of the application.

There are also various files including:
* README.md (recursive)
* LICENSE.md
* CHANGELOG.md
* INSTALL.md
* BUGS.md
* app.js
* package.json
 
* LICENSE.md professes the GPL.
* CHANGELOG.md is a stub for specifying changes that may happen at each revision.
* INSTALL.md is a stub for specifying installation instructions for the app.
* BUGS.md is a stub for specifying what current, outstanding bugs are left with the app.
* app.js is a stub for the entry point of the app server.
* package.json is a stub of the metadata used with Node Package Manager.
