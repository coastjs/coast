Coast
=====

Coast is a convention-over-configuration platform for building RESTful APIs with Node.JS and XMLHttpRequest.

## Installation

    which npm   # Installed?
    which node  # Installed?
    which coast # Installed?
    # Install npm & node >=0.10 from http://nodejs.org/download/

    # {prefix}/bin, where {prefix} is usually something like /usr/local. It also installs man pages in
    # {prefix}/share/man, if theyâ€™re supplied.
    npm install coast -g
